      Any society that allows itself to become radically unequal eventually
      collapses into an uprising or a police state—or both. Join venture
      capitalist Nick Hanauer and some of the world’s leading economic and
      political thinkers in an exploration of who gets what and why. Turns out,

      something about rising inequality, the pitchforks are coming.
